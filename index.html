    - name: Trader Joes List
      description: >
        We all know how confusing grocery shopping can be sometimes.
        That's why I created Trader Joes List, a handy application for managing your shopping lists.
        With this app, you can easily add, edit, and delete items from your list, making your grocery trips a breeze!
      problem_solving: >
        Managing complex lists, optimizing performance, and integrating barcode scanning were the hurdles I faced.
        But I tackled them head-on! I implemented smart state management techniques to handle those long shopping lists.
        I also optimized the app's performance to make it lightning-fast.
        And the coolest part? I integrated barcode scanning functionality so you can just scan the items and get all the details instantly!
    - name: Gallery of Games
      description: >
        The Gallery of Games is like a time machine that takes you back to the good old days of classic arcade-style games.
        I built this collection using Python and the Pygame library, bringing back the nostalgic charm of games like Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and Snake.
        It was a challenge, but I paid attention to every little detail to ensure an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience.
      problem_solving: >
        Figuring out collision detection, game logic, and making the games run smoothly was tough.
        But I didn't give up! I came up with clever solutions like using bounding box detection and pixel-perfect collision methods.
        I also optimized the game's performance to keep it running smoothly.
    - name: Urban Potatoes
      description: >
        Imagine a website like Rotten Tomatoes, but with a twist.
        Urban Potatoes is a movie rating platform where movie lovers and fanatics like us get to be the critics!
        I built this platform using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend framework like Django or Node.js.
        It's a user-friendly website where you can discover new movies, rate them, and share your reviews with the community.
      problem_solving: >
        Handling movie data, integrating external APIs, and managing user-generated content were real challenges.
        But I found clever solutions! I implemented caching to improve performance and reduce API calls.
        I also used data processing techniques to aggregate and filter movie data efficiently.
        And of course, I made sure to handle user-generated content with proper validation and security measures.
